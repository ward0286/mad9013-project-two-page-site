          One-shots are snack-sized adventures that allow you to get right into
          the action of Dungeons & Dragons without the baggage that comes with
          an extended campaign. In addition, the self-contained nature of
          one-shots enables players and Dungeon Masters to more easily
          experiment with the breadth of options D&D provides without
          commitment. Maybe you want to play as a party of meme characters,
          complete with janky multiclassing shenanigans? Or perhaps your DM
          wants to try their hardest to brutally kill the characters one by one?
          Whatever avenue you're looking to explore with your one-shot, it can
          make for a fun night of gaming!
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, we're paying homage to one-shot adventures in D&D.
          We'll discuss why we love them, some tips for running them, and our
          favorite one-shot adventures!
        </p>
        <div class="blog-content__oneshot">
          <h2>What Is a One-Shot?</h2>
          <p>
            One-shots are D&D adventures that can be finished in one 3-4 hour
            session. These adventures are more streamlined because of the tight
            turnaround time. One-shot adventures are usually meant to be
            self-contained, not needing any context from outside of the
            adventure to be run.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Why We Love One-Shots</h2>
        <p>
          One-shots are a casual way to get a session of D&D in without the
          legwork that comes with a campaign. Players can try out new builds and
          personalities, while DMs don't have to worry about managing a
          campaign, keeping notes, or writing a continuous narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing as one-shots lack the commitment of an extended campaign, they
          provide a number of unique benefits:
        </p>
        <h3>Switch Up the Group Dynamic</h3>
        <p>
          One-shots are the perfect time to allow aspiring DMs at your table to
          step up for a session. While long-term campaigns might be daunting for
          a new DM, one-session adventures that don't require as much backstory,
          planning, and management are excellent ways to gain experience. One of
          the most prominent benefits of this is that it gives your table's
          "forever DM" a break.
        </p>
        <p>
          While switching up DMs is one of the best ways to experience a
          different table dynamic, switching party roles can be another way to
          completely change the feel of your game. Maybe your peaceful cleric is
          tired of healing your party and wants to rage as a barbarian? Or maybe
          your warlock wants to go on the straight and narrow with a paladin?
        </p>
        <h3>Try New Things</h3>
        <p>
          If you're anything like me, you have 10 janky character builds ready
          to go at all times. One-shots are the perfect time to try out your new
          creations without the stakes of being stuck with the same character
          for 100 sessions (or until they meet their untimely demise).
        </p>
        <p>
          This can also allow you to experiment with different campaign
          settings. If your group is used to playing in a traditional fantasy
          setting, one-shots are an excellent way to expand your horizons. The
          adventure anthology
          <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/adventures/journeys-through-the-radiant-citadel?icid_medium=ddb&icid_source=article&icid_campaign=one-shots&icid_content=radiant-citadel"
            >Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</a
          >
          could be an ideal starting point for tables looking to experience
          unique takes on fantasy while sticking to the one-session adventure
          format.
        </p>
        <h3>Play D&D Without the Strings</h3>
        <p>
          Agreeing to play D&D usually comes with a commitment. If your group
          can't dedicate a night every week (or two … or four …. or eight) to
          D&D, one-shots are the perfect option to get some game time while you
          have everyone together. If you're hanging out with friends and looking
          for something to do, a one-shot is much easier to put together than a
          campaign!
        </p>
        <p>
          One-shots are also a great way to introduce new players to the game.
          The focus on straightforward gameplay will help streamline the
          player's learning, and the reduced obligation can make things easier
          for those with a busy schedule. You can even help the newer players by
          offering pregenerated characters, so they can focus on gameplay rather
          than the myriad of options they're presented with during
          <a

            >character creation</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Enjoy a Themed Play Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Personally, my time to run a one-shot is for a holiday, like
          Halloween, Valentine's Day, or Christmas. One-shots work particularly
          well for the over-the-top spooky or goofy themes these celebrations
          often inspire. While these grandiose tropes would get tiresome over
          the course of an extended campaign, one-shots are often the perfect
          dose of festive holiday spirit!
        </p>
        <h2>Tips for Running One-Shots</h2>
        <p>
          While they may not have as many gears as a full-blown campaign,
          one-shots can be deceptively tricky to run well. Of course, there are
          a few aspects that make them better for newer DMs or DMs looking for a
          break—less worldbuilding, a streamlined story, and throwaway
          characters—but the session itself requires more oversight than your
          typical session. In a regular campaign, if the players get off the
          rails and spend hours adopting a group of goblins, it's no big deal
          and can even make for a funny improv session. On the other hand,
          one-shots need to stay on track, or they will take longer than the
          single prescribed session.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as there aren't any restrictions with your table, it's usually
          not a huge deal if your one-shot turns into a two- or three-shot. But
          if you're looking to run a compelling one-session adventure, here are
          some tips:
        </p>
        <h3>Keep the Intro Short</h3>
        <p>
          When time is of the essence, introducing characters and establishing
          the story needs to be fast-forwarded compared to a long-term campaign.
          If it takes the party an hour to describe their characters, decide if
          they want to work together, then negotiate their contract, you'll
          probably have to cut things from your planned adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've found an excellent method of expediting this process is to send
          players the introduction for the adventure ahead of time. I ask them
          to brainstorm ahead of time how their characters know one another.
          Then, on game day, I kick off the one-shot by describing how the
          characters got their quest and the information they need to know. This
          allows me to jump straight into the action without distraction.
        </p>
        <h3>Expedite Combat</h3>
        <p>
          Combat is usually the most time-consuming element of D&D. While it can
          be fun for players to test their character's abilities, the last few
          rounds of combat can drag on if the battle is wildly in favor of the
          party.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to reduce the time investment required for combat is to
          set a "retreat scenario" for the party's opposition. Maybe the bandits
          your party is facing will run if their leader is killed? Or perhaps an
          owlbear with less than half of its hit points can be scared away with
          a Charisma (Intimidation) check?
        </p>
        <p>
          Having alternate win conditions for combat allows the party to still
          feel satisfied with their victory while giving you more time for
          social interactions and exploration!
        </p>
        <h3>Vary the Play</h3>
        <p>
          While a combat-heavy session in a long-term campaign can be balanced
          out by having a roleplay-heavy session the following time you play,
          one-shots don't have that luxury. This means that one-shots should
          visit all aspects of D&D play—combat, exploration, and social
          interaction—to ensure that players are given a chance to make their
          character feel effective. Barbarians might love an entire session of
          crushing their foes, but maybe the rogue wants to do some sneaking
          while the bard chats up a bartender for information?
        </p>
        <p>
          Including the three core aspects of D&D gameplay in a one-shot makes
          for a good one-shot, but a great one-shot intersperses these scenarios
          throughout the adventure to avoid any one aspect becoming stale. Think
          of your one-shot as a lasagna; you should layer your sauce, cheese,
          and noodles (combat, exploration, and social interaction in this
          metaphor) so that every bite has enough of each!
        </p>
        <h2>Our Favorite One-Shots</h2>
        <p>
          We have a published library of
          <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/tag/free-adventure"
            >free homebrewed adventures</a
          >
          designed to be played as one-shots, as well as various
          <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/tag/encounter-of-the-week"
            >encounters of the week</a
          >
          that can be a starting point for creating your own one-shot. There are
          also plenty of modules in published materials that can be run as
          one-session adventures. However, we understand that the sheer number
          of one-shot options can make choosing one to run intimidating. To help
          get you started, here are some of our favorite one-shots from
          published D&D books:
        </p>
        <h3>Death House</h3>
        <p>
          This intro adventure contained in Curse of Strahd isn't necessary to
          run as part of a Curse of Strahd campaign but is perfect for a spooky
          session. Consider leveling the party up to 2nd or 3rd level depending
          on their experience. Death House tends to live up to the "Death" in
          its name.
        </p>
        <h3>The Price of Beauty</h3>
        <p>
          A fantastic adventure full of exploration, mystery, and social
          interaction from the Candlekeep Mysteries anthology.
        </p>
        <h3>Salvage Operation</h3>
        <p>
          A great nautical tale found in Ghosts of Saltmarsh. This adventure
          features a climactic final encounter where the party has to escape a
          ship being attacked by a kraken that I am particularly fond of.
