## Comments

### HTML
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

### CSS
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

### Responsive Design
- You have applied the narrower `45em` container width, which is too narrow, for a number of your sections. Stick with the base `65em` for most content.
  - The exception is the blog content. When you have large amount of text, the narrow container is better.
- You should not use a bold, script font for body copy. It is challenging to read.
- Recent Blog Posts should be in 3 equal columns. You have used a larger font size and a smaller container, meaning there isn't enough space within the columns forcing them to be different sizes.
  - You also switch from 1 to 3 columns at too small of a screen size, causing the columns to overflow.
